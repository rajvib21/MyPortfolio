        <p className="mt-6">
          I am an aspiring AI & Machine Learning enthusiast who enjoys learning
          deeply and building projects from scratch. I’ve participated in
          hackathons and technical trainings, continuously improving my skills.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          Beyond tech, I am a classical Bharatanatyam dancer with 15 years of
          experience and a completed bachelor’s degree, along with training in
          music.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          I love travelling and planting, which keeps me grounded while I explore
          technology and innovation.
